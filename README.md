# Introduction-to-Nodejs
## Answers to Numbers 1 to 5
1. Monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture pattern where all the components of an application are tightly integrated into a single indivisible unit. All the different modules of the application, including the user interface, database, and server-side logic, are tightly coupled and run on a single codebase and platform, in a single process.
It is very easy to develop but very difficult to maintain and scale.

2. In my own understanding, microservices is a modern software architecture where an application is broken down into small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. Each service focuses on a specific capability or functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services. 
It is very flexible, easy to maintain, and more efficient in scability, unlike the monolithic architecture.

3. The microservices appeals to me because it offers more flexibility and scability especially as I intend to work with firms that deploy applications with large codebases and many functionalities. 

4. Nodejs is not a multithreaded language, however, it could be used to perform non-blocking I/O operations with the help of event loop. 
 
5. REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print Loop.

6. Answer is in the index.js file
